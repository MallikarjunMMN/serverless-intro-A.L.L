# Creative Coding using C++ and Cinder  

## Part-1
To compile the main.cpp file, in your terminal type:
    
    g++ main.cpp

This will create an executable file in the same directory.  
To run the executable, in your terminal type:

    ./a.out

If you wish to name the executable, when compiling you can specify by running:

    g++ main.cpp -o <name>

## Part-2
Part 2 uses Xcode to compile and run. (You will need Xcode installed)  
To open the project, open the part-2.xcodeproj in xcode.  
You can also open in the terminal by typing:

    open part-2.xcodeproj

You can then write your code in the main.cpp file just like normal and use Xcode to build and run.

## Cinder Basic
This project was created using TinderBox which is an application provided by Cinder.  
(You may or may not need Cinder installed and built on your system to run this)

There are 5 parts that are commented out and separated by lines.  
Each part renders something different. Feel free to mess with the code to see what you can do.
